Event driven file processing Pipeline on Google Cloud
This project deploys a Google Cloud Function that triggers when a file is uploaded to a GCS bucket and loads it into a BigQuery table automatically.

└── README.md # This documentation file
✅ Prerequisites
Python 3.7+
Google Cloud SDK installed (gcloud init)
Google Cloud account with billing enabled
Enable the following APIs:
Cloud run functions
BigQuery
Cloud Storage
Create or use an existing GCP project
✅ Use Case
Whenever a new .csv file is uploaded to the specified GCS bucket, this function:

Gets triggered by the GCS finalize event
Reads the CSV file
Loads the content directly into a BigQuery table (with autodetect schema)
🔧 Setup Instructions
1. Prerequisites
A Google Cloud Platform account
Billing enabled on your GCP project
Google Cloud SDK installed (gcloud init)
Enable these APIs:
Cloud Functions
BigQuery
Cloud Storage
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/gcp-dataengineering-mini-projects.git
cd gcp-dataengineering-mini-projects/1.event-driven-file-processing
2. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Configuration
Before deploying, update the following values in deploy.sh:

PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
BUCKET_NAME="your-bucket-name"
REGION="us-central1"
FUNCTION_NAME="gcs_to_bigquery"
RUNTIME="python311"

BQ_DATASET="your_dataset"
BQ_TABLE="your_table"
4. Setup GCP Environment
This script will create a GCS bucket, BQ dataset and table, enable the necessary API services, granting service account permissions and finaly deploy the cloud function

chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
Now your GCP Environment is Ready !!!! Now your cloud function is ready to run when new file arrives in GCS bucket

🚀 Trigger the cloud function by uploading file to GCS bucket
gsutil cp ./sample_files/sample1.csv gs://your-bucket-name/data.csv

The function will trigger and load data into the specified BigQuery table.

✅ Done! You’ve now built an event-driven data pipeline using GCS + Cloud Function + BigQuery.
